# postgresql_sequences (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database` (String) The PostgreSQL database which will be queried for sequence names

### Optional

- `like_all_patterns` (List of String) Expression(s) which will be pattern matched against sequence names in the query using the PostgreSQL LIKE ALL operator
- `like_any_patterns` (List of String) Expression(s) which will be pattern matched against sequence names in the query using the PostgreSQL LIKE ANY operator
- `not_like_all_patterns` (List of String) Expression(s) which will be pattern matched against sequence names in the query using the PostgreSQL NOT LIKE ALL operator
- `regex_pattern` (String) Expression which will be pattern matched against sequence names in the query using the PostgreSQL ~ (regular expression match) operator
- `schemas` (List of String) The PostgreSQL schema(s) which will be queried for sequence names. Queries all schemas in the database by default

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `sequences` (List of Object) The list of PostgreSQL sequence names retrieved by this data source. Note that this returns a set, so duplicate table names across different schemas will be consolidated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sequences))
