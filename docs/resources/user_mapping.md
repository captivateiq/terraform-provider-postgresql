## Schema

### Required

- `server_name` (String) The name of an existing server for which the user mapping is to be created
- `user_name` (String) The name of an existing user that is mapped to foreign server. CURRENT_ROLE, CURRENT_USER, and USER match the name of the current user. When PUBLIC is specified, a so-called public mapping is created that is used when no user-specific mapping is applicable

### Optional

- `options` (Map of String) This clause specifies the options of the user mapping. The options typically define the actual user name and password of the mapping. Option names must be unique. The allowed option names and values are specific to the server's foreign-data wrapper

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
